# Code examples for the ***PACE*** project

This repository contains applications for the **PACE** project, implemented in
multiple programming languages and using a variety of frameworks. It is intended
as a reference for comparing approaches, learning patterns, and testing
framework-specific or language-specific features.

## Structure

Each folder corresponds to a different application or framework/language
combination. For example:

```
idg/python # Image-Domain Gridding in Python
idg/cpp # Image-Domain Gridding in C++
```

## Purpose

The code in this repository may contain simplified versions of production code
to demonstrate concepts and usage patterns. It is **not production-ready**, but
rather a playground for experimentation, benchmarking, and learning.

## Usage

1. Navigate to the folder of the language/framework you want to explore.
1. Follow the instructions in the folder-specific `README` (if available).
1. Run or build the application as described.
